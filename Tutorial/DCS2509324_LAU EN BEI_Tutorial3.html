<p>
<font size=4>
A <b><em><font size=5>shepherd</font></em></b> boy in a village used to 
take his herd of sheep across the fields near the forest.
He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.
</p>
<br>

<p>
One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted. "Wolf! Wolf! 
The wolf is carring away a lamb!" Famers working in the nearby 
fields came running for help but didn't find any Wolf.
</p>
<br>

<p>
The boy laughed and replied, "It was just fun." There are no wolf here. 
<b><em><font size=5>The boy played a similar trick repeatedly for many days.</font></em></b>
</p>
<br>

<p>
After some days,while the shepherd boy was in the feld with the herd of sheep, 
suddenly, a wolf came out from the nearby forest  and attacked one of the lambs. 
The boy was frightened and cried loudly, "Wolf! Wolf! <del>The wolf is carrying
 a lamb away!</del>"
</p>
<br>

<p>
<font color=#4C0099><big>The farmers</big> <sup>thought</sup> <big>the boy was playing</big>
<sub>mischief</sub> <big>again.</big></font> So, no one paid attention him and didn't 
come to his help.
